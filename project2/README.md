## Project #2
The purpose of this application was to put together a fun game written in a different language from what we learned in our bootcamp. 
- I created this application because I wanted to learn Swift language since it's what I would be using in my job at Verizon and I thought a fun first project would be a game. 
- I decided to create a matching card game that would work on mobile devices. Once a player flipped cards that were matching then those cards would dissapear so that they could only choose the ones that were not matched yet. If they picked cards that did not match they would be turned back around to the red side. 
- In order to create this application, I first had to learn some Swift language. Once I got some understanding of it I was able to start on my project and with the help of videos on Youtube and Google I was able to put a matching game together.
